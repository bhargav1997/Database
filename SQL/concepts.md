Let's delve into various database-related concepts and practices using SQL examples.

### Views
A view in SQL is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement. It can be used to simplify complex queries or to restrict access to specific columns of a table.

**Example: Creating a View**
```sql
-- Creating a view to display selected columns from a table
CREATE VIEW EmployeeView AS
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, emp_department
FROM Employees
WHERE emp_status = 'Active';
```

### Triggers
Triggers are special stored procedures in SQL that are automatically executed (fired) in response to specific events, such as INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations on a table.

**Example: Creating a Trigger**
```sql
-- Creating a trigger to log changes to the Employee table
CREATE TRIGGER AuditEmployeeChanges
AFTER UPDATE OR DELETE ON Employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO AuditTrail (change_type, emp_id, change_date)
    VALUES (IF(OLD.emp_status IS NULL, 'INSERT', 'UPDATE'), OLD.emp_id, NOW());
END;
```

### Stored Procedures
A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save, reuse, and share. It can accept parameters, perform actions, and return results.

**Example: Creating a Stored Procedure**
```sql
-- Creating a stored procedure to retrieve employee details by ID
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeDetails(IN empID INT)
BEGIN
    SELECT emp_name, emp_department
    FROM Employees
    WHERE emp_id = empID;
END;
```

### Functions
Functions in SQL are similar to stored procedures, but they typically return a single value and are used to encapsulate business logic.

**Example: Creating a Function**
```sql
-- Creating a function to calculate the age of an employee
CREATE FUNCTION CalculateAge(dob DATE) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
    DECLARE age INT;
    SET age = YEAR(CURDATE()) - YEAR(dob);
    RETURN age;
END;
```

### Normalization
Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

**Example: Normalizing Tables**
```sql
-- Example of normalizing tables to reduce redundancy
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(50),
    emp_department_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (emp_department_id) REFERENCES Departments(dept_id)
);

CREATE TABLE Departments (
    dept_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    dept_name VARCHAR(50)
);
```

### Data Types, Keys, and Constraints
These are fundamental concepts in SQL for defining the structure and relationships of data within tables.

**Example: Defining Table with Keys and Constraints**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    emp_department_id INT,
    emp_salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    emp_hire_date DATE,
    CONSTRAINT fk_dept
        FOREIGN KEY (emp_department_id)
        REFERENCES Departments(dept_id)
        ON DELETE SET NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Departments (
    dept_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    dept_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);
```

In the examples above, we've covered various SQL concepts such as views, triggers, stored procedures, functions, normalization, data types, keys, and constraints. These are foundational elements in database design and development using SQL.
